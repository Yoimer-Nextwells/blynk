/***************************************************************
* This part of the code was used in a test project under Windows and Arduino UNO with Luis Castillo and Yoimer Romï¿½n from NextWells company. Venezuela-USA.
* Instrucctions:
* - Get on Google Play Store or IOS Store and Download blynk. After installing, sign up.
  - On your browser from you PC type http://docs.blynk.cc/. Check out the "Intro" section. Read this part carefully.
  - We will need the blink libraries in our Arduino IDE in order stablish a connection with the Cloud Blynk Service. To do that; get
     the lastest version of the libraries from here. https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/releases/tag/v0.4.3 (Blynk_Release_v0.4.3.zip)
     At the time this document was made, the lastest release was v0.4.3. Yours may vary.
  - In case you've forgotten how to install libraries in Arduino IDE;
     check this link on "Manual installation" https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries
    After installing the Blink libraries, open an empty Scketch from Arduino IDE.
    Copy and paste the ***NextWells-BLINK-ARDUINO UNO******* code Upload it to the Arduino UNO board.(This code is above)

  - After succesfully uploading the code,extract the Blynk_Release_v0.4.3.zip files on C:\ directory.
    This is for running the script which will make us get online with the Cloud Blynk Service.
  - Run the blynk-ser.bat script. In order to do that , open cmd promt and get on this path C:\Blynk_Release_v0.4.3\libraries\Blynk\scripts>
    Issue this command : blynk-ser.bat -c COM3 (In your case check your Arduino COM port) and press Enter, Enter , Enter (Yes, 3 times)
    If there is Internet Connection and everything is OK, you should see something similar to this on the promt console:

    Connecting device at COM3 to blynk-cloud.com:8442...
    OpenC0C("\\.\COM3", baud=9600, data=8, parity=no, stop=1) - OK
    Connect("blynk-cloud.com", "8442") - OK
    InOut() START
    DSR is OFF

-   Now you should be able to play with the GPIO from the Blink app. For testing try Turning ON and Turning OFF the LED on PIN 13 using a botton.
